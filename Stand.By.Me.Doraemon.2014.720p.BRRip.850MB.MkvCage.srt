1
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,310
Noby!

2
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,470
Over here!

3
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,590
Shizuka!

4
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,100
- This is fun!
- Okay!

5
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,440
Hurry!

6
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,640
Wait for me!

7
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,750
Noby, wake up!
You won't have time for breakfast!

8
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:09,850
You'll be late for school!

9
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,900
A dream..

10
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,620
(( He went back to sleep.
He'll be late for school ))

11
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,410
(( Noby! Wake up already! ))

12
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,280
(( Mom, Why didn't you wake me?! ))

13
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,580
(( I tried many times. ))

14
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,300
I'm off!

15
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,950
I can still make it.

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,880
(( See? I knew it. ))

17
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,800
(( Let's keep watching. ))

18
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,930
We had steak 3 days in a row

19
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,500
Noby...

20
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,000
Still standing in the hall?

21
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,740
How does it feel to be
punished for being late?

22
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,400
I wouldn't know.
I've never been punished.

23
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,540
Yo, Sneech.

24
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,280
Give him a break.

25
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,470
He's been standing forever and he's tired.

26
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,900
Big G.

27
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,720
You can play ball with us today.

28
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,940
Be thankful.

29
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,980
I have another plans.

30
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,250
What? Don't be so cocky.

31
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,920
Stop it, you two!
You're hurting him.

32
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,450
It's none of your business.

33
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,810
Don't talk to me like that.

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,980
I'm fine, Shizuka.

35
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,850
(( He needs a girl's help. ))

36
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,700
(( He's more pathetic than I thought. ))

37
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,430
Next! Noby!

38
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,820
Okay!

39
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,160
Noby! Nice catch!

40
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,740
- Let me try, big brother.
- Okay, just once, Little G.

41
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,830
Thanks.

42
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,130
(( Pretty bad at sports. ))

43
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,850
(( You're right. ))

44
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,570
(( He's studying. Maybe he's smart. ))

45
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,660
(( I don't know... see? ))

46
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,600
(( Something fell. ))

47
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,900
(( Let's not do this.
It's no use going. ))

48
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,800
(( We have to do something. ))

49
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,450
(( - We have to help him.
- Not possible! ))

50
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,670
(( Let's go talk to great-great grandfather. ))

51
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,500
If not, I'm going to
push the button on your nose.

52
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,480
Okay, okay. Whatever you say.

53
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,640
STAND BY ME
DORAEMON

54
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,240
It's opening.

55
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Noby... You're Noby, right?

56
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Aaaargghhh!

57
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,420
- Seal!
- Don't be so rude!

58
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,530
But I can't blame you.
It's dark in here

59
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,920
Good evening, I'm Doraemon.

60
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,390
Aaaa......

61
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,450
Let me come out.
Oh, a drawer?

62
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,350
Hi, I'm Soby.

63
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,800
Why were you in there?

64
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,160
Stay calm and listen.

65
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,190
We're from the future.

66
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,500
Wow, how does this work?

67
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,720
Your things in the drawer are safe.

68
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,900
They're in here in my Four-dimensional Pocket.

69
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,440
I can fit anything in it.

70
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,640
Lots and lots of things.

71
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,390
Here you go.

72
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,730
Thank you.

73
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,490
In any case, I still don't understand.

74
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,900
You're my descendants?

75
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,550
Your grandchild's grandchild.

76
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,390
I come 4 generations after you.

77
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,630
I'm still a kid,
I don't have grandkids.

78
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,760
Yummy!

79
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,720
What is this called?

80
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,790
Yummy buns.

81
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,690
I've never had anything so good.

82
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,640
Great-great grandpa,
you'll be an adult one day, right?

83
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,110
You'll get married, right?

84
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,000
- I will?
- Yes. 19 years from now.

85
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Really?

86
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,270
Who am I gonna marry?

87
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,720
Your wedding photo,
Her name is Little G.

88
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,120
- Little G?
- Your life from then on.

89
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,700
My wife... A bully like her...

90
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,630
You're lying!
Go away! Go!

91
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,330
Get out of here!
I don't believe you!

92
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,700
Don't get mad, okay?

93
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,560
Unless things change,
your life is the pits.

94
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,630
Look at this.

95
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,480
You can't find a job,
so you start your own company.

96
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,890
But, your office burns down in a fire.

97
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,650
Your debts from the fire snowball.

98
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,900
That's why we're really poor.
All our things are old and shabby.

99
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,190
Got it?

100
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,650
I'm sorry.
I caused you guys so much trouble.

101
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,890
I wish I could disappear.

102
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,820
Hey, don't get so down,
you can change your fate.

103
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
Really?

104
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,350
That's why we're here.
Right, Doraemon?

105
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,680
I still haven't said yes.

106
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,270
Hold on.

107
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,870
Doraemon, we talked about this.

108
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,380
All right then.
You're making me do this.

109
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,120
Until you help Noby be happy...

110
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,660
....you can't come back to the future.

111
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,600
You're so mean, Soby!

112
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,400
Doraemon will take care of you.
I'm quite busy.

113
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,500
I can't! Impossible!

114
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,920
It's programmed so you can come
back once Noby finds happiness.

115
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,970
Really?

116
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,800
Even if you don't want to,
you'll have to come back.

117
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,200
Of course I'll want to go back.

118
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,640
I'm counting on you, Doraemon.

119
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,420
He could be a bit difficult.

120
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,700
But I'm sure you'll
be glad to have him around.

121
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,850
See ya!

122
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,390
Thanks, Doraemon.

123
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,260
I can't do this,
I'm going back to the future.

124
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,960
Improper words detected.

125
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,600
Okay, I get it!

126
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,530
I'll help Noby find happiness.

127
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:16,790
I can't believe Soby
really activated the program.

128
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,100
I hope I'm not hurt.

129
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,140
Can you really help me?

130
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,400
I'll show you how
amazing the 22nd century is!

131
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,610
Copter!

132
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,900
- What is it?
- Don't worry.

133
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:45,670
What does it do?
Go out the window?

134
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,810
You'll enjoy it.

135
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,450
Aaaaarrrrggghhh!

136
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,490
I'm floating!

137
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,150
Cool, right?

138
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,640
It hurts. I'm not dreaming.

139
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,300
Help!
I'm gonna fly off into the space!

140
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:32,300
Calm down! Calm down!

141
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,380
Stop! Stop! Stop!

142
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,870
It stopped.

143
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Noby!

144
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,520
Start working!

145
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,380
Start working! Please!

146
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,120
Noby! Wait!

147
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,390
I can't swim!

148
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,480
You're getting the hang of it.

149
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,400
This is easy once you get used of it.

150
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,200
Even little kids can used it.

151
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,740
What is it?

152
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,270
Shizuka's house.

153
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,880
- A friend?
- Yeah, classmate.

154
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,730
Let's go surprise her.

155
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,240
Is she still up?

156
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,120
She's sleeping. Too bad.

157
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,110
She's pretty.

158
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,000
You think so?
Even in future standards?

159
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,860
Really? I see, I see.

160
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,280
I totally like...

161
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,830
What?

162
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,720
Noby, you're still up?
Go to sleep.

163
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,420
What did you just say?

164
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,300
Me and Shizuka... We're getting...

165
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Married?

166
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,540
I wanna get back to the future.

167
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,700
I think it's the
surest way to make you happy.

168
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,440
Me? Marry Shizuka?
I feel awkward.

169
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:31,570
You don't have
to go through all the trouble...

170
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,910
So you don't want my help?

171
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,630
Yes, I do.

172
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
But how?

173
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,930
I'm go to school!

174
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Doraemon?

175
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,260
No more being late for school.

176
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,870
Anywhere Door!

177
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,850
What's that?

178
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,600
Say where you want
to go and open the door.

179
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,300
School!

180
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,680
I got a new toy yesterday.

181
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,120
Good morning.

182
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,190
Noby's early. Unbelievable.

183
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,110
Shizuka...

184
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,480
Hi, Noby.

185
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,580
Good morning.
You're early today.

186
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,770
Memory Bread!

187
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,750
Eat it and you can
memorize what's written on it.

188
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,940
Here! Here! Here!

189
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,410
I know the answers!

190
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,400
You got better score than me!

191
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:59,650
Doraemon, I wanna beat Big G!

192
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,520
Invisible Cape!

193
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,690
Mom! I'm hungry!

194
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,270
Hey! Who's doing that?!

195
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,260
Ouch! My boil!

196
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,830
Grabber Glove!

197
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,200
Being good at sports
can make you popular.

198
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,700
I caught it!

199
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,260
Nice catch!

200
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,570
I saw that! Mr. S!

201
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,840
Doraemon!

202
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,970
Time Kerchief!

203
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:50,810
Things go back to the way they were.
You can also fast forward them.

204
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,510
You shouldn't lie like that.

205
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Weird!

206
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,780
Shizuka, what are you drawing?

207
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,460
Doraemon!

208
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,170
Instant Wardrobe Cam!

209
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,260
Draw an outfit.

210
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,590
Sketchbook, please?

211
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,310
- Make it cute.
- You got it.

212
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,930
Say cheese!

213
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,900
You pervert!

214
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,750
Speed winder!

215
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:34,790
Put this on and it'll speed you up.

216
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,180
You sure are working hard today.
Doraemon is helping, isn't he?

217
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,840
- I'm finished!
- You are?

218
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,690
Helping your mom?
Good for you.

219
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,270
Will you clean the living room now?

220
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,390
Okay!

221
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Gulliver Tunnel!

222
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,240
So big!

223
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,270
Yippee!

224
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,200
Underground Tree House!

225
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,670
Extra Hot Cloud Spray!

226
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,230
Shizuka! Good morning!

227
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,820
Good Morning, Noby!

228
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,910
You're on a roll these days.
Thanks to Doraemon?

229
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,870
Yeah. I feel like I can do anything.

230
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,440
Shizuka! Can I talk to you?

231
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
Sure.

232
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,850
Oh yeah! I forgot about him.

233
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,710
Good at sports. Good at school work.

234
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,200
And a really nice guy.
My classmate Ace...

235
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,870
Hey, Noby. You're early again.

236
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,600
You're saying no matter how much
you use gadgets of the future...

237
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,730
...you can't beat your classmate Ace.

238
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,440
Don't underestimate me!

239
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,240
I'm a cat-shaped robot from 22nd century.

240
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,450
There's nothing I can't do!

241
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,930
Hang on. I'll find a gadget
that will make Shizuka...

242
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,940
...fall in love with you.

243
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,990
Imprinting Egg!

244
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,380
What's this?

245
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,760
Know about imprinting?

246
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,700
I guess you wouldn't.

247
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,910
Some animals, especially birds
treat the first thing they...

248
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,560
...see as their parent.

249
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:02,490
Even a toy bird.

250
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,400
This is called imprinting.

251
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,630
Do you understand?

252
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,470
You have no brains.

253
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:19,540
Putting it simply,
get Shizuka this egg.

254
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:23,890
Close it and a timer will start.

255
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,980
15 minutes later, she'll fall in
love with the person she sees.

256
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,700
Why you didn't tell me in the beginning?

257
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,840
What an amazing gadget.

258
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,470
Shizuka's heart will be mine.

259
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,800
This gadget is very powerful.

260
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,650
It has complete control over its subjects.

261
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,510
Me, I wouldn't use such a cowardly gadget.

262
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:03,250
No, Noby. Wait!

263
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,870
Boy, it's heavy.

264
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,420
Stop!

265
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,880
Big G! Stop it!

266
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,940
Are you okay?

267
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,220
He's in the egg, which means..

268
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,750
Noby honey..

269
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,570
Go! Go!

270
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,340
What's this?

271
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,570
Hi Big G, what are you doing?

272
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,650
That was expensive, you know?

273
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,950
You're so cute!

274
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,480
You just noticed?

275
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,900
I just got this. It's crushed

276
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:23,750
Sneech! I'll never let you go again!

277
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,750
Okay?

278
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,650
Help me!

279
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,100
Why you running?

280
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,740
Holy cow, that's strong.

281
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,840
Phew, that was close.

282
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,800
I don't think you should use it.

283
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,330
Why not?

284
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,160
You saw what happened.
It's a bad idea.

285
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,990
I wanna be popular too.

286
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,300
Are you sure about this?

287
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Yes.

288
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,960
Let's have Shizuka enter it here.

289
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,970
How?

290
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,600
- See you.
- Yeah, see you.

291
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,350
Yes, Doraemon!

292
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,550
- What's that hole?
- Anywhere Hole!

293
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,600
It's connected to Shizuka's front door.

294
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,520
That's great!
Now we wait for 15 minutes, right?

295
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,640
Go on and get out of here.

296
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,840
I don't want her
to see you by mistake.

297
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:43,510
I can hardly wait for 15 minutes.
When she comes out...

298
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,280
Hey, Noby!

299
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Now what?

300
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,560
That weird egg! It's Doraemon's, right?

301
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:00,170
I need help! Do something!

302
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,490
I'm busy right now.

303
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,500
Big G right around the corner.

304
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,570
Sunie-poo! Where are you?

305
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,830
He's here! Move!

306
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,790
Oh, I forgot!

307
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,990
Shizuka!

308
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,660
Go get Doraemon!

309
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:30,260
- Where is he?
- Go find him.

310
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,190
There you are, Sunie-poo!

311
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,300
You're my everything!

312
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,820
Help! Mommy!

313
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,850
Shizuka!

314
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,960
Noby, What's going on?

315
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,710
How could you let this happen?

316
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,600
I told you it was a bad idea.

317
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Please! You have to put her back!

318
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:17,810
What? This will fix her but...

319
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,370
Ace?

320
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,900
Don't you like me?

321
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,330
Of course I do.

322
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,510
I like you a lot too.

323
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:35,450
But I don't want to rely on a gadget.

324
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,640
He won't use a gadget...

325
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,450
I like you even more than before.

326
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,200
Ace..

327
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,220
He's impressive.

328
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,590
He's just too perfect.

329
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,410
But me, on the other hand...

330
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:21,900
You're klutzy and slow
and you hate to study.

331
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,160
Shut up.

332
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,530
- Timid, lazy, dense.
- Leave me alone.

333
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,760
Bad at sports and a coward.

334
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,810
Forgetful, unreliable, goof-off..

335
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:40,510
You're so lame that
you can't be compared to Ace.

336
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,100
You don't have to be so mean.

337
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,110
Now you know you can't make
the gadgets do all the work.

338
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,190
You yourself also have to make effort.

339
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,200
Me, huh?

340
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,920
- Galaxy!
- Whoa! But that's...

341
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:10,150
I'm not good at anything.

342
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,400
If you don't at least try,
you'll never change.

343
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,370
You're okay with that?

344
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,590
Good night.

345
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,210
110 times 6 is...

346
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:53,160
660. Yes! I'm right.

347
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:00,860
Next. 120 divided by 6...
This is hard.

348
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,660
What's going on?
Studying so early in the morning.

349
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,680
Did I wake you? Sorry.

350
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,340
I thought about it.

351
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:18,970
I'm gonna try not to
get a zero on my next test.

352
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,160
Mom gave me more allowance today.

353
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,680
Look. Noby's studying.

354
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:38,460
Wow! I'm so impresses Noby!

355
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,910
38.

356
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,850
- 120 divided by 3.
- 40.

357
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,880
- 13 x 5.
- 65.

358
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,210
- 25 x 3.
- 75.

359
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,480
800.

360
00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:00,730
Good luck on your test tomorrow.
I'm sure you'll do great.

361
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,970
There you are.

362
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,290
Here, Sneech.

363
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,440
You're acting so weird, Noby.

364
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,480
I'm not the guy I used to be.

365
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,940
You better not get a good score.

366
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:33,780
Then I'll apologize right now. Sorry.

367
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,200
Okay, Start.

368
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,200
Oh my God! No!

369
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,700
Noby, you got a zero.

370
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,950
- Again?
- I'm sorry.

371
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,700
At this rate, you'll flunk elementary school.

372
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,560
I'm worried about your future.

373
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,860
I'm so reassuring to
have Noby in the same class.

374
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,790
Don't be so smug.
You only got 10 points

375
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,160
It's not that different.

376
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:23,250
Noby!

377
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,730
- How was the test?
- Don't ask.

378
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:32,810
Come on. You studied so hard.
I bet you did well.

379
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,580
I'm not telling you.

380
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,750
Don't be so shy.

381
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,530
All right. Bring-It-Bag!

382
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:45,860
I'll just fetch
the test paper from Noby's bag.

383
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:49,830
What? Japanese Test?

384
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,440
You were studying for a math test.

385
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,980
I can't stand this!

386
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:04,500
I can't stand myself anymore!

387
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,480
Noby...

388
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,780
Leave me alone.

389
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,850
Be careful when you run!

390
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,660
See what I mean?
Are you okay?

391
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,770
Come on, sweetie.

392
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,200
I made up my mind.

393
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,110
Hi, Noby.
What are you doing?

394
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,260
He's being weird.

395
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,650
- Mom, I need a favor.
- I'm not buying you anything.

396
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:57,150
It's nothing like that.
Let's move somewhere far away.

397
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:01,640
Don't be silly.
Why do we have to move?

398
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,300
Then let me go study abroad.
How about the U.S.?

399
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:10,490
Stop talking nonsense
or you'll be in trouble.

400
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:18,550
I'll just have to take
matters into my own hands.

401
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:24,710
Noby, you tried really hard.
Don't worry about failing.

402
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,980
If other people can do it,
so can you.

403
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,550
Here it is.

404
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,940
Are you listening to me?

405
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,650
It doesn't matter anymore.

406
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,880
I'm giving up on marrying Shizuka.

407
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,500
Why?
You don't like her anymore?

408
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Yes I do!
I like her a lot!

409
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,300
She's everything to me.

410
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,280
Then why?

411
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,500
I thought hard about it?

412
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:08,600
If she marries me,
She'll be unhappy forever.

413
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,190
Until now,
I only thought about myself.

414
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:21,250
But If I really do care about Shizuka...

415
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,800
...she's better of without me.

416
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:31,280
It's hard saying goodbye. But....

417
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,220
It's harder thinking that
I'll be making her unhappy.

418
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,500
Shizuka! Noby is here!

419
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,220
I'm taking a bath.

420
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,590
I just came to return some books.

421
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,560
I'll always be wishing
for Shizuka's happiness.

422
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,750
Tell her I said goodbye.

423
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,780
Noby?

424
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,420
I'm doing the right thing.

425
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,820
Noby!

426
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,480
What's the matter?
Are you angry at me?

427
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
Don't ask.

428
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,910
We better not see each other anymore.

429
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,220
I won't leave until you say why.

430
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,470
What am I supposed to do?!

431
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,610
I'll make her hate me.

432
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,130
Jerk!

433
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,220
I hate you.

434
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,230
He's really serious.

435
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,160
I can't believe he did that.

436
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,610
I'm doing the right thing.
But it's tough.

437
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,840
Noby, what are you doing?

438
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:32,610
Ace! You're a good guy.

439
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,330
Take good care of Shizuka.

440
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:49,120
Noby, want a yummy bun?
These are especially good.

441
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,170
No! I'm not in the mood.

442
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:54,650
- Just a bite.
- I'm not like you.

443
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,750
Just eat it!

444
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,680
I said, I don't want it!

445
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,460
I don't usually share my yummy buns!

446
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,640
Noby's acting real weird.

447
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,150
I agree.

448
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:12,340
Noby's really depressed about
getting a zero on that test.

449
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,240
I would be too.

450
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,860
If Mr. S told me I might flunk..

451
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,520
...I'd be hating life.

452
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,620
(( Tell her I said goodbye. ))

453
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,270
Oh, no.

454
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,850
- Noby!
- It's Shizuka!

455
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,720
- I know you're there!
- Yikes!

456
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,560
- Come here
- What should I do?

457
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,300
- Noby!
- I have to make her hate me.

458
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,120
Don't be stupid.

459
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,430
That would put me
in a tight spot as well.

460
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,000
Just do something!

461
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:58,540
- If you insist...
- Hurry up!

462
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,110
Despica-portion!
This should do it.

463
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,500
Noby! Shizuka is here!

464
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:09,640
It'll make Shizuka hate you.
So will everyone else too.

465
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,840
Got it?
One sip was enough!

466
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:23,940
Nothing's happening.

467
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:34,910
What's wrong, Doraemon?

468
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:41,780
Doraemon?

469
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,590
I don't feel well.

470
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,960
I can't stand it,
Just being close to you...

471
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,320
You make me sick!

472
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:13,880
I drank too much.
I feel sick.

473
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,100
Help!

474
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,250
Oh, no..

475
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,300
I'm going to die.

476
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,460
Noby...

477
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,000
Shizuka...

478
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:14,500
Get it out.
You'll feel better.

479
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,470
Go on.

480
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:27,670
How odd... Why was I running?

481
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,360
Phew. I feel better.

482
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,420
I thought you poisoned yourself.

483
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:43,520
Were you that worried about me?

484
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,000
Of course I was! You're my friend!

485
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,690
And don't be so weak!
It's just Mr.S!

486
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,340
You jerk.

487
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,390
Jerk.

488
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:02,430
Oh, boy..that was really tough.

489
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,000
Oh my God! Why?!?

490
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:10,690
She was so mad at me.

491
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,160
The stars are so pretty tonight.

492
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,280
What's the matter?

493
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:32,890
You see, because of today's events,
your future has started to...

494
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,920
I'm not telling you.

495
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,620
What are you talking about?

496
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,240
Nothing.
If I tell you, you'll get lazy.

497
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,750
Oh, come on.
Tell me. Just a little bit.

498
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,250
- Tell me!
- Why should I?

499
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,520
- I said tell me!
- That tickles.

500
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,300
It's dangerous up here.

501
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,300
You're right.

502
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:02,710
When your future
is starting to look good...

503
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,200
What? Look good?

504
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,560
Wanna take a peek?

505
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,180
Oh yeah!

506
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,500
Where did it go? Let me see.

507
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,520
Here it is!

508
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,200
At this point...

509
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,230
...this is your future.

510
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,120
A grown-up Shizuka.

511
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,160
She's so pretty.

512
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:34,300
The boy getting a spanking
looks exactly like you.

513
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,210
That means...

514
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,600
I must have married...

515
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,240
Shizuka!?

516
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,860
Yes! Yes!

517
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,920
This is awesome!

518
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,970
Thank you, Doraemon.
I owe everything to you.

519
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,920
You're wrong, Noby.

520
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,830
Out of the millions of possibilities...

521
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:12,410
...you grabbed the opportunity.

522
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,170
My future changed.

523
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,560
Your new future.

524
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:22,180
Yeah, my new future.

525
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:27,380
Your kindness is about
to change the future.

526
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,940
Will you marry me?

527
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,100
Yes, I'd love to.

528
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:47,230
You're proposing to her?!
That's not fair!

529
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,200
No, Noby.
We're practicing for Cinderella.

530
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,250
We're putting on a play.

531
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200
What?

532
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,260
It's not working.

533
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,970
Actually I was surprised too.

534
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,510
Why would Shizuka marry you?

535
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:17,590
There's so many better guys out there.

536
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:18,590
Watch it!

537
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:22,690
When my future was
starting to look good...

538
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:28,600
She might end up marrying Ace.

539
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,750
If you're that worried,
let's watch Time TV.

540
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,680
You're supposed to get engaged...

541
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:40,970
...14 years from now on Oct 25.

542
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,310
So let's see what
happened a little before that.

543
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,340
Are you serious?

544
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,920
That's you grown up.

545
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,460
Same as ever.

546
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Mountain climbing?

547
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,670
Are you going or not?

548
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:05,130
That's Shizuka.

549
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:08,670
I want to.
But I hate climbing.

550
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,250
I would if the mountain's flat.

551
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,640
You need to grow up.

552
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,880
Whatever. I'll take another friend.

553
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,100
I can't watch this.
Fast forward it.

554
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:30,770
What?

555
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,960
Shizuka's alone.

556
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,100
She must have gotten
separated in the blizzard.

557
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:38,530
- She's in trouble!
- You're right.

558
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:41,900
What's grown-up Noby doing?

559
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,720
In bed with a cold.

560
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,900
Oh, man.

561
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,380
Wait. I got it!

562
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,800
Time Kerchief, please.

563
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,270
What are you gonna do with it?

564
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,440
This fast forward things, right?

565
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,510
14 years from now.

566
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:11,570
I'll ride the Time Machine
and go save Shizuka.

567
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:13,830
Are you okay, Shizuka?

568
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:21,260
You're wonderful, Noby!
And we'll get married.

569
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,140
Will it work that well?

570
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,500
I'll go get ready!

571
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,210
I'm ready.

572
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,600
Come on. Let's go to the future.

573
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:36,970
Wait a second.

574
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,800
You're not thinking thoroughly.

575
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:43,520
Using the Time Machine could
change the future again.

576
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,360
What?

577
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:48,710
It doesn't necessarily
change for the better.

578
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,790
You're so dramatic.

579
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,770
I have to hurry
and go save her.

580
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:04,660
Hang on tight. If you fall off,
you'll be lost forever in time.

581
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:08,160
Okay. Here we go then.

582
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:30,400
My house is a public toilet.

583
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,390
The neighborhood turned into a park.

584
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,520
Everything's so different.

585
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,340
Let's go. Get out Anywhere Door.

586
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,400
You make me work hard.

587
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,780
Take me to Shizuka!

588
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,170
There she is!

589
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:00,780
You stay behind. I'm going to
save her without your help.

590
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:03,690
Shizuka!

591
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,000
Good luck.

592
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,650
Shizuka!

593
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,320
It can't be...

594
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,000
Shizu...!

595
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,800
The cottage is still far away.

596
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,220
Shi...!

597
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,350
It's been 3 hours
since we got separated.

598
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:40,730
Shizuka, you okay?!

599
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,580
It's me, Noby.

600
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,730
Noby? Why are you here?

601
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:52,620
It doesn't matter.

602
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,670
Everything will be
fine now that I'm here.

603
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,700
When you're lost in a snowstorm,
don't walk around blind.

604
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,620
First of all, check the map.
This is the iron rule.

605
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:08,790
Uh-oh...

606
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:14,180
That's a world map.
That's so you.

607
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:20,790
This Auto Compass
will show us the direction.

608
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,870
That's convenient.

609
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,130
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

610
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:37,900
When we were kids, Doraemon would
come to your rescue at times like this.

611
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:41,870
What did you say?

612
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:45,590
I wonder how Doraemon is doing.

613
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:49,260
Probably taking a nap or something.

614
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,300
Oh, Noby... You're so silly.

615
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,220
Just like a kid.

616
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:58,310
Kid?! She knows?!

617
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,530
There's a cave.
Let's take a break.

618
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:08,360
We have to make sure
we don't freeze to death.

619
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:11,100
Let's start a fire.

620
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,130
The matches are wet.

621
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,620
No worries.
I know how to start a fire.

622
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:23,600
I just have to rub
2 sticks together.

623
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,920
Now's my chance.

624
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,540
I have to...

625
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:29,530
Impress her.

626
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,000
It's not working.

627
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,810
Want my lighter?

628
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,270
Why didn't you tell me?

629
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:46,340
I didn't want to interrupt.

630
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,590
Do you have a cold?

631
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,690
I don't feel too well
but it's no big deal.

632
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,900
She caught it
from the grown-up Noby.

633
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,300
Nothing.

634
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:07,580
When you came to see me,
I must have given it to you.

635
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:12,160
It's my fault.
I don't take good care of myself.

636
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,690
Wear this. I'll be fine.

637
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,390
It's wet.

638
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,890
Your clothes must be wet too.
Aren't you cold?

639
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:31,200
Now that you mention it...
I'm cold.

640
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,340
You better take them off.

641
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,360
I don't have change.

642
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,550
I have an emergency blanket.

643
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,330
Thanks.

644
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,880
This is really warm.

645
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:50,630
I'm glad.

646
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,220
Is your cold getting worse?

647
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:15,170
What should we do?
You could die!

648
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:18,950
Don't say that.

649
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,980
You really haven't changed at all.

650
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:27,170
I worry about you. You need
someone to look after you.

651
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:37,640
Yeah... all right.
The answer to your question is...

652
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,150
Yes.

653
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:46,720
I thought you'd be happier.

654
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:53,250
Shizuka!

655
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,600
What should I do?

656
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,220
Help, Help, Doraemon!

657
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,760
Doraemon!

658
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:09,780
This nice weather
is making me drowsy.

659
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,280
Shizuka!

660
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:17,590
I'll take her to Anywhere Door.

661
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,120
This yummy bun is so yummy...

662
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,590
I'll share one with you...

663
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:45,450
It should be somewhere around here.

664
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:54,960
Warning. Pulse rate is dropping.
Contact a physician immediately.

665
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,560
Oh, no!

666
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,460
Ha! The Auto Compass!

667
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,940
I twisted my ankle.

668
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:21,150
I even lost my glasses.
I can't see anything.

669
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:24,650
Using the Time Machine could
change the future again.

670
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:28,710
Oh my God! What should I do?!

671
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:32,500
It doesn't necessarily
change for the better.

672
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:34,600
This isn't what I wanted!

673
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,840
Please! Shizuka will die!

674
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:40,130
I'll study!
I'll do anything!

675
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,600
I'll change!

676
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:45,500
What are you doing?!

677
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,740
I didn't think thoroughly.

678
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,300
It's my fault.

679
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:02,220
I have to do something by myself.

680
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:04,430
There must be a way.

681
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,400
I have to believe in him

682
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:19,420
The watch is still working.

683
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:22,370
I memorized the time
and the year right now.

684
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:24,470
Now it's up to the grown-up Noby.
I'll believe in myself.

685
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:28,710
Go! This memory!
Please, future me!

686
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:30,810
Remember this incident!

687
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:37,640
I wouldn't forget
the biggest crisis of my life!

688
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,110
Go! Go!

689
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:41,130
Go!

690
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,780
This memory!

691
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,660
Hey!

692
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:42,740
Hey!

693
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:46,300
The memory reached him!

694
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:51,360
Hey! You guys okay?!

695
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:09,370
You remembered.

696
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:15,500
Yeah. I was in bed with a
cold and suddenly remembered.

697
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,420
It's like the memory
flew into my head.

698
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:20,450
It felt weird.

699
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:25,550
I didn't know why
I had forgotten it.

700
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:31,710
Then I couldn't sit still
anymore and rushed to come here.

701
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,150
I was scared.

702
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:39,950
You're okay now.
Your plan worked.

703
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:43,910
It's weird saying
this to myself but...

704
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,900
Thanks for believing in me.

705
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,700
I only had me to rely on.

706
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:57,430
Thanks for relying on me.

707
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:03,120
Now let's hurry.
I'm worried about Shizuka.

708
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,240
He's back.

709
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:32,380
- How is she?
- She was in real danger.

710
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:35,930
But she's okay.
She'll be fine.

711
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,500
Thanks to you.

712
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:41,270
That's great.

713
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:45,430
Huh?

714
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,520
Doraemon.

715
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:50,710
- Yeah.
- Shall I go get him?

716
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,530
No, Don't.

717
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:58,380
Why not?

718
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:02,190
Doraemon is your...

719
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,800
My friend from childhood.

720
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,220
Cherish your time with him.

721
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,470
I should go home.
I feel a fever coming on.

722
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:22,800
Yeah. Um..Thanks, me.

723
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,800
Take car, me.

724
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,100
See ya.

725
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,720
The grown-up Shizuka said
something before she passed out!

726
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,260
She said something?

727
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,450
She said her answer is yes!

728
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:39,690
Her answer is yes?

729
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:42,580
What?!

730
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,180
Again...

731
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,780
Tell me again!

732
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:55,500
The grown-up Shizuka said her
answer to your question is yes.

733
00:59:56,330 --> 01:00:00,130
That's... That's...

734
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,410
That's...!

735
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:07,170
Ouch! What's the matter?

736
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:13,670
Yes! Are you sure she said that?

737
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,780
I don't get it.

738
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,100
I proposed to her.

739
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:25,640
I'm impressed by me, Noby.

740
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,000
She didn't give me
an answer for a long time.

741
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,750
Are you okay?

742
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:40,690
I have to go.
I have to go see Shizuka.

743
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,000
Shizuka!

744
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:50,790
He completely lost his cool
just because she said yes.

745
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:52,970
He proposed and she said yes...

746
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:59,210
We're getting married?

747
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:07,190
Doraemon!

748
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,830
What? Are you serious?

749
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:13,570
Really? Really?

750
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:18,700
Yes! That's wonderful!

751
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,420
Noby, that's great!
I'm so happy for you!

752
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:30,980
Wow! You're amazing!

753
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,520
- Shall we go watch?
- Yeah. Let's.

754
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,470
The wedding!

755
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:55,890
- We're here.
- Today's your wedding.

756
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:58,710
I'm getting nervous.

757
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:01,870
Look.

758
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,830
On the way to the wedding.

759
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:05,950
Let's follow!
We need Copters!

760
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,500
Here.

761
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,720
He's in a rush.

762
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,920
Probably running late
even on a day like this.

763
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:28,400
Wow, This is the future world.

764
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:31,100
Noby, watch out!

765
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:42,570
- Behind you!
- Behind me?

766
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:08,000
Sorry.

767
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,100
Let's go.

768
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:26,310
I'm Noby!
I'm sorry I'm late!

769
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:32,880
Your ceremony is scheduled for tomorrow.

770
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,600
What?

771
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,440
The wedding is tomorrow.

772
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:43,600
You may be older but you haven't changed.

773
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:46,330
Then why did we arrive today?

774
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:49,600
I made a mistake.

775
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:51,480
See?
Everyone makes mistakes.

776
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:56,500
But now that we're here
let's stay and watch you.

777
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,540
Yeah.

778
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,860
Hi, Sneech.

779
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,140
Where are you?
Tonight's your bachelor party.

780
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,000
At Big G's house.

781
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,400
Oh, yeah.

782
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:20,290
I still can't believe it.
You're getting married tomorrow.

783
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:25,880
I bet Shizuka is gonna
look so pretty tomorrow.

784
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,500
We all had crushes on her.

785
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:33,320
But she fell for you.

786
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,480
Make her happy, okay?

787
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,910
Yeah.

788
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:42,920
I wish I were
the one to make her happy.

789
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:48,600
But she said I can do
everything on my own.

790
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:51,840
I see. You too, Ace?

791
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:56,280
- Noby! Stay right there!
- Yeah, stay there.

792
01:04:56,290 --> 01:05:01,290
If it was Ace, I could give up.
But why you?

793
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:03,780
You're just Noby.

794
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:07,210
You're so lucky.

795
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,480
That hurts, Big G.

796
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,780
What's so funny?

797
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,890
Keep it down!
I have a deadline!

798
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,700
Little G.

799
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:18,520
Hi, Little G.
Long time no see.

800
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:21,350
Noby, congratulations.
You're getting married.

801
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:24,300
She became a manga artist.

802
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:29,700
If you make Shizuka cry,
my pen will coming after you.

803
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:34,580
I know, I know.
Thank you.

804
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,520
I look so happy.

805
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,780
You're practically drooling.

806
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,590
I can't watch anymore.

807
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:44,670
I wonder what Shizuka is doing.

808
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:48,760
Probably crying about
her hasty decision to say yes.

809
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,940
Thanks a lot.
Now I have to go see.

810
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,730
Wait!

811
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:01,170
Come in.

812
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:08,590
Dad, I'm going to sleep now.
Good night.

813
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:11,750
Good night.

814
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:14,730
She seems down.

815
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,660
You can't blame her.
She's marrying you.

816
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:20,620
Good night.

817
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:28,200
That's it?
But she's getting married tomorrow...

818
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,260
It's hard to talk
at times like this.

819
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,220
Truth Transmitter.

820
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:36,400
If someone has
something they're holding back...

821
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:39,970
...this makes them want
to get it off their chest.

822
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,200
Dad!

823
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,460
I want to call off the wedding.

824
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,500
- Why?!
- Dad...

825
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,680
What's wrong?

826
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:55,290
You'll miss me when I'm gone.

827
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:57,740
Of course I will.

828
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:02,660
You and mom have taken
such good care of me.

829
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,580
But me...

830
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:08,220
I haven't done
anything for you in return.

831
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:12,580
Don't be silly.

832
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:17,510
You've given us
so many wonderful things.

833
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:20,100
I have?

834
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:23,370
So many I lost count.

835
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:28,910
Your first gift was that you were born.

836
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,610
It was 3 a.m.

837
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:35,310
Your first cry sounded
like an angel's trumpet.

838
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:39,910
The most beautiful music I've ever heard.

839
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:44,240
When I left the hospital,
the sky was beginning to light up.

840
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:50,220
But there were still
stars scattered in the sky.

841
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:52,800
In this vast universe...

842
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:57,730
...a new life was born
carrying my blood.

843
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:04,170
I was so moved
that I couldn't stop crying.

844
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:07,820
And everyday,
every year since then...

845
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:15,820
All the happy memories.
We can't ask for anything better.

846
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:20,140
We'll miss you but those
memories will keep us happy.

847
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,600
You don't have to worry.

848
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:27,590
I'm afraid.

849
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,720
Will we be all right?

850
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:34,280
Sure you will be.
Have faith in Noby.

851
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:39,400
You were right in choosing him.

852
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:43,900
He's an ordinary guy
with no particular talent.

853
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:48,940
But he wants people to be happy
and cries for their pain.

854
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:53,550
That's what makes a good human being.

855
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:59,120
I'm confident he will make you happy.

856
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:04,140
And I'm proud of you for choosing him.

857
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:09,630
Don't worry.
Everything will work out fine.

858
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,240
Okay.

859
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:21,530
Why don't we watch
the wedding on another day?

860
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:26,580
Yeah. Let's go back to the present day.

861
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:29,130
I miss Shizuka, the one in my era.

862
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:42,340
What's up?
What's so urgent?

863
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,670
- Shizuka...
- Noby?

864
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:51,640
I'll make you happy.
Forever and ever!

865
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:56,170
I promise you.

866
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,820
You're so slow, Doraemon!

867
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:12,630
Doraemon...

868
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:16,800
Can I borrow a Copter?

869
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:20,110
Okay, here.

870
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,520
Come here.

871
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,440
What is it?

872
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,380
You see...

873
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:32,490
Right now...

874
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:36,510
I'm...

875
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,380
Just say it.

876
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:47,190
I'm so super happy that I want...

877
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:50,250
...the whole world to know!

878
01:10:55,930 --> 01:11:01,290
(( Noby's happiness confirmed.
Mission Program accomplished. ))

879
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:04,810
(( Return to the future in 48 hours. ))

880
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,900
Oh, yeah.
That's how Soby programmed it.

881
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:15,750
I'm so glad.

882
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,240
I'm relieved.

883
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:22,840
Now I can finally go back.

884
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:26,710
You really are...

885
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:29,200
...klutzy and slow.

886
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:32,860
You hate to study.

887
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,630
You're timid and lazy.

888
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:41,590
You're so bad at sports.

889
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:46,800
Cowardly and forgetful.

890
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:52,240
You're unreliable and you goof off.

891
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:59,470
You're a wimp and a slow learner.

892
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:06,620
A pushover and a luck pusher.

893
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:10,160
A spoiled baby...

894
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:15,370
Hey!

895
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:21,800
Uh-oh... What's wrong with me?

896
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:36,480
Doraemon!

897
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:42,140
I need a gadget for
eating pasta through my nose.

898
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,660
If I don't, Big G's gonna beat me up!

899
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:49,110
Don't make promises you can't keep!

900
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:54,230
You always depend on me!
Do things on your own for once!

901
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:57,180
Why are you so mad?
What's wrong?

902
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,840
I'll tell you what's wrong!

903
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:04,470
I can't help you anymore
when you're in trouble!

904
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,200
What do you mean?

905
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:14,150
What's gotten into you?

906
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:19,440
I can't stay here anymore.

907
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:23,660
Do something!

908
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,820
I'm sorry, Noby.

909
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:30,390
I have to go back tomorrow
or I'm in trouble.

910
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:36,300
Noby, that's enough.

911
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,300
Let him go.

912
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:40,850
Come back and visit us.

913
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:44,240
But this program...

914
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,880
...won't let me
come back to this era.

915
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:52,500
Is that right?
We'll miss you.

916
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,870
- Take care.
- No! Don't go, Doraemon!

917
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:01,300
I don't want to.
I'd stay if I could.

918
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:05,110
(( Improper words detected ))

919
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,840
Oops!

920
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,480
I'll go back to the future!

921
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:14,570
Doraemon!

922
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,790
Are you okay?!
Doraemon?

923
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:24,400
I can't defy the Mission Program.

924
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:37,350
Noby, I don't know what to say.

925
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:44,200
Don't be so sad.

926
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:54,390
Your future changed.
Be happy.

927
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:58,270
It's meaningless without you.

928
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:04,540
You changed as well.
You're not the guy I first met.

929
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:12,250
Still...

930
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:16,700
I'm worried.

931
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:21,610
I wish I could stay with you.

932
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:25,570
Will you be okay without me?

933
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,200
Will you be able
to stand up to Big G and Sneech?

934
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:34,790
Noby!

935
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:43,990
- Where are you going?
- Leave me alone.

936
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:45,610
Noby!

937
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,600
Doraemon, you idiot...

938
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:59,320
You know I'm not okay on my own.

939
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,720
Hey, Noby!

940
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,300
I'm glad you're here.

941
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:11,960
Big G...

942
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:15,990
Have you decided?

943
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:19,140
Eat pasta through your nose?

944
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:22,200
Or get beat up by me?

945
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:25,740
Help me, Dora....?

946
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:30,560
(( Will you be able to stand
up to Big G and Sneech? ))

947
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:36,140
- Hold on!
- Huh?

948
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:41,200
(( Can you do it alone? ))

949
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,660
If we're gonna fight...

950
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,880
Let's leave Doraemon out of it.

951
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:56,800
How brave of you.
Now you're talking.

952
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:00,560
Ready to start?

953
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,560
It already started!

954
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:10,200
I wonder where Noby is?

955
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,340
It's our last night together.

956
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:18,910
So you give up?

957
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:21,930
Don't ever disrespect me again.

958
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,960
Wait. I haven't lost yet.

959
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:26,830
What?

960
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:29,530
You haven't had enough?

961
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,900
I'm just getting started!

962
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:45,180
He's still not home.
What is he doing? Where is he?

963
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:49,710
Making me worry even on my last night...

964
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,400
Had enough now?

965
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:03,130
Not yet!

966
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,220
Noby!

967
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:12,210
Where is he?

968
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:23,520
Noby!

969
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:32,100
He's been gone too long.
Something must have happened.

970
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:38,140
Let go of me!

971
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,440
I've gotta beat you...

972
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:43,920
...on my own...

973
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,730
I have to show...

974
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:56,430
...Doraemon that...

975
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:59,820
...I'll be okay without him!

976
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,480
Buzz off!

977
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:06,820
You...!

978
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:09,300
Enough already!

979
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,940
Okay, okay, you win.

980
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,940
Forgive me, Noby!

981
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:08,630
Noby!

982
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:22,820
I won.

983
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:25,920
You saw, didn't you?

984
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:28,980
I won.

985
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,260
By myself.

986
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:42,950
Now you won't
have to worry about me.

987
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:50,280
Right, Doraemon?

988
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:25,360
Noby! Finish your breakfast!

989
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,800
Okay.

990
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:32,120
(( Doraemon.. ))

991
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:38,900
(( My room feels empty without you ))

992
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:40,270
I'm coming!

993
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:50,640
(( But I'll get used to it soon ))

994
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:54,940
(( So don't worry about me, Doraemon. ))

995
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:08,400
(( What?! Tsuchinoko? ))

996
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:12,440
I thought they were a myth!
That's amazing!

997
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:15,420
Keep your voice down.

998
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:19,400
I chased it in here
so poke it from that side.

999
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,520
I'll catch it here.

1000
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:22,620
Okay.

1001
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:35,370
Ouch!

1002
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:37,530
Serves you right!

1003
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:44,100
Ouch..that was a mean prank.

1004
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:49,780
Noby!
Thank goodness I found you!

1005
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,230
Stay calm and listen.

1006
01:22:56,270 --> 01:23:01,570
Guess who I just saw?

1007
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,900
Ready?

1008
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:09,680
Do-ra-e-mon.

1009
01:23:11,490 --> 01:23:12,490
Doraemon?!

1010
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,360
Hello?

1011
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:19,850
Doraemon!

1012
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:24,980
Doraemon!?!

1013
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,850
Mom!?

1014
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:34,620
Are you okay?

1015
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,530
I'm okay.

1016
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:38,880
Is Doraemon here?

1017
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:42,550
What? Is he back?

1018
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:46,540
He's not here?
That's weird.

1019
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:50,910
Oh, I know!

1020
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:58,170
He's being shy and hiding
with an invisible Cape.

1021
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:01,200
I can't wait to see him.

1022
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:07,150
I think I'll go buy some yummy buns.

1023
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:11,740
I hope Doraemon is here
when I come back.

1024
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:20,240
Yummy buns, yummy buns.

1025
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:25,100
My lie was better than yours.

1026
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:28,640
Yes, you win.

1027
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:31,340
You were lying?!

1028
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:35,200
Today's April Fools' Day!

1029
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:38,440
You're easier to fool
than anyone I know.

1030
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:47,420
- Lie and get us back then.
- Yeah.

1031
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:49,830
There's a ghost behind you!

1032
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:55,460
What is this Kindergarten?

1033
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,160
Doraemon...

1034
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:13,610
Oh, yeah!

1035
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:17,520
When I'm gone...

1036
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:21,590
...and something really horrible happens...

1037
01:25:22,110 --> 01:25:23,610
Here it is.

1038
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:27,600
(( Press the switch on the nose. ))

1039
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:33,910
(( You'll find whatever you need inside ))

1040
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,640
This potion is called Liar Liar Liquid.

1041
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:46,450
Drink this and
everything you say will become a lie.

1042
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:49,910
Perfect for April Fool's Day.

1043
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:55,200
That lie about Doraemon was the
cruelest thing they could've said.

1044
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:58,740
They're gonna regret it.

1045
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:02,180
Oh no, a ghost!

1046
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,400
Look, Big G!

1047
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:07,100
He looks pumped up.

1048
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:09,980
Another stupid lie?

1049
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,410
Give it to us.

1050
01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:14,230
Go ahead!

1051
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:17,580
Will you apologize to me?

1052
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,780
- Then fine.
- Listen to him.

1053
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,180
Nice weather today.

1054
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,600
That's it?

1055
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:42,430
It's raining hard.

1056
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,660
What did you do?!

1057
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:48,440
What next?

1058
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:50,790
He's spooking me out.

1059
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:55,130
Let's see..

1060
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:56,660
Sneech...

1061
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:00,990
Won't be bitten by a dog!

1062
01:27:01,710 --> 01:27:02,710
Dog!

1063
01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:06,310
Dog! Help!

1064
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,160
Big G.

1065
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:13,840
Your mom is gonna be super nice to you.

1066
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:17,930
There you are!

1067
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:21,190
You're supposed to be
helping out at the shop!

1068
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:24,900
You're in big trouble.

1069
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:28,410
Mom! I'm sorry!

1070
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,210
Mom!

1071
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:46,480
- I'm home.
- Hi.

1072
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,940
Did you find Doraemon?

1073
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:58,380
Of course not.

1074
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:09,180
Doraemon's not coming back.

1075
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,880
I'm never seeing him again.

1076
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:32,110
Noby!

1077
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:38,850
Why? How?

1078
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:43,300
It was so strange. Suddenly
I was allowed to come back.

1079
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:48,400
I know why, you drank this...

1080
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:51,140
...and said I wasn't coming back.

1081
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,300
I'm not happy...

1082
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,900
Not happy.
I'm not happy at all.

1083
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:14,210
Not happy at all.

1084
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:17,380
Really not happy.

1085
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:21,770
Forever from now on...

1086
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:27,360
Doraemon and I won't stay forever...

1087
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:29,610
No we won't.

1088
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:33,260
We will not stay together.

1089
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:58,630
STAND BY ME DORAEMON
